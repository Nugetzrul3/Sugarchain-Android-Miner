# Sugarchain-Android-Miner

This app is still in WIP. The GUI and buttons are functional, however the miner needs to be added. Also, there are still some persisting issues. You can download the prerelease and test saving a configuration and seeing if the app is able to load your configuration. If there are any issues, please make an issue and put a screenshot, as well as a short description of what you were doing that caused this issue.

TODO:
- [x] Force app to have vertical orientation
- [ ] Fix scaling issues with other devices
- [ ] Suggestion: Adding a double back button
